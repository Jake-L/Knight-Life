<p>Hi, my name is Jake and this is a game I'm working on. I've never used Javascript or HTML before, so I'm hoping to learn a lot about web development through this project. This game is a 2D action / exploration game, and will hopefully feature online multiplayer at some point.
</p>
<p>While working on this project, I've discovered a limitation of my laptop's keyboard that interferes with this game. The keyboard can only detect the first two key presses if you push a combination of arrow keys and space bar. For this reason, I will prioritize adding custom key bindings.
