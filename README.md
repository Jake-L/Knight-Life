Hi, my name is Jake and this is a game I'm currently working on. When I started I had never used Javascript or HTML, but I really wanted to learn. I have come a long way since then, as this game now features online multiplayer, a simple (and laughably insecure) user registration system, an experience / leveling system, multiple maps, achievements, and quests. I still have a ton of ideas for how I want to improve this game, and I intend to continue working on it for a long time. 

If you are interested in trying out this game, download this repository, run the run.bat file, then navigate to localhost:5000 in your internet browser. If you open another tab in your browser and open the game, you will see both of your players on the screen. Anyone else on your LAN can also connect to your game at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5000, where the xxx's represent your private IP address. If you have any issues running it, you may need to install the dependencies listed in package.json using npm.
