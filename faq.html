		<p><b>What are the controls for this game?</b></p>
		<p>Move your character using the arrow keys and press '1' to jump, '2' for a primary attack, and '3' for a secondary attack. In the future, the key bindings will be fully customizable. If you experience any issues with the controls, keep in mind that most keyboards have a limit to how many keys on a circuit you can press at once. On my laptop's keyboard, it does not recognize three key presses if I hold down two arrow keys and the spacebar at the same time, which is why the default jump button is 'F' instead of the spacebar.</p></body>
